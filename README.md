# DeepaMehta 4 Sign-up

This plugin introduces a configurable user registration process for DeepaMehta 4 _User Accounts_.

Most (if not all) user facing message are translatable by now. A german language version of this bundle can be build from source after setting the language option to `de` using the `plugin.properties` file.

This plugin adds:
*   A "User Mailbox" association type to associate "Email Address" w. "User Accounts".
*   A `Sign-up`-link next to the `Login`-button in the DeepaMehta 4 Webclient
*   A `Sign-up Configuration` topic associated to the `DeepaMehta 4 Sign up` Plugin
     (part of the "System" workspace and thus editable by all members of it)

The special features of the **registration ui** is comprised of:
*   Username existence check
*   Email existence check
*   Simple GUI-Notification mechanism
*   Minimal CSS Definition

The special features of the **login ui** is comprised of:
*   Simple GUI-Notification mechanism
*   Automatic redirect
*   Minimal CSS Definition

The **special logic** of this plugin is comprised of:
*   Optionally: Configure a sign-up process with an Email based confirmation workflow<br/>
    Sends confirmation mail with token to the users registering Email address<br/>
    Allows for the password reset functionality to take place also via an Email based confirmation workflow
*   Optionally: Send notifications to system administrator after a new user account was sucessfully created
*   Optionally: If `new_accounts_are_enabled=true`, an account activation notice is sent
*   Optionally: If the email based confirmation workflow is used a "Passwort reset" workflow is available

**Note:** If `Email Confirmation Required` is set to _true_ the confirmation tokens the system sends out are **not persisted** and get lost after a bundle/system restart. Once a token was send out the link containing it is valid for sixty minutes.

Each "Sign-up Plugin Configuration" topic allows you to control 13 settings to adapt the sign-up process to your look & needs.

The standard sign-up configuration topic initially resides in the "Administration" workspace and the "Custom Workspace Membership Request" note resides in the "System" workspace.

Email addresses of new user accounts are all placed in the "System" workspace too.

## Requirements

DeepaMehta 4 is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.
https://github.com/jri/deepamehta

To be able to install this module you first and additionally have to install the following DeepaMehta 4 Plugins.

*    `dm48-thymeleaf-0.6.1`-Bundle - Build from [sources](https://github.com/jri/dm4-thymeleaf)

**Operations:** For the plugins mailbox validation process to run you must install this plugin with deepamehta4 on a web server with a 
`postfix` -> `Internet Site` like mail send functionality.

## Download & Installation

You can find the latest stable version of this plugin bundled for download at [http://download.deepamehta.de/](http://download.deepamehta.de/).

As mentioned above, you currently need to download and install the aditonally required `dm48-thymeleaf-0.6
.1`-Bundle, too.

After downloading the two bundle-files, place them in the `bundle-deploy` folder of your DeepaMehta installation and restart DeepaMehta 4.

## Plugin Configuration

The central topic for configuring the sign-up dialog for your DeepaMehta 4 installation is of type `Sign-up Configuration`. Editing this topic via your dm4-webclient allows you to interactively control/adapt many options.

Setting a configuration option to an empty value usually means deactivating the features depending on it.

The sign-up configuration is associated with the "Plugin" topic representing this plugin ("DeepaMehta 4 Sign up"). It can be edited by all members of the `Administration` workspace.

### Setup Custom Workspace Assignment

There is currently just one special configuration option. To setup a workspace which self-registering users should automatically join (become members of) you need to associate that very workspace topic with your active sign-up configuration. And here comes the pitfall: To take this "custom workspace assignment" into effect you must either restart the platform or press "Edit" on your sign-up configuration topic once (in both cases the configuration is reloaded and therewith comes into immediate effect, see [#1](https://github.com/mukil/dm4-sign-up/issues/1)).
